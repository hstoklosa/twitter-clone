<p align="center" style="">A simplified version of X/Twitter built in React and Node.js using Express & MongoDB.</p>

## Roadmap üéâ

The goal of this side-project is to create a fully functional full-stack Twitter clone, which will be deployed and used as my resume project. I believe that such project is a perfect opportunity to further & demonstrate my coding capabilities.

The project is currently in the beginning phases of development, and in order to keep track of the progress, the following README will contain series of information (stack, features, specific todos).

Over the summer of 2023 (or longer if neccessary), I will be working on this project until it will be of a satisfactory standard to be deployed and included as my resume project.

### üîç Features

-   [x] User Authentication
-   [x] Profile page & management options
-   [x] Following/Followers
-   [x] Tweeting (text & images)
-   [x] Commenting, retweeting, quoting, liking
-   [x] Algorithmic feed
-   [x] Search Functionality (user/tweets/hashtags)
-   [ ] Real-time direct messaging
-   [ ] Real-time notifications - likes, retweets, follows, DMs

## üîå Technologies

_MERN Stack:_ I'm embracing the opportunity to delve into the realm of NoSQL databases, a new direction for my development skills.

MongoDB, a key component of this stack, stands out due to its widespread acclaim in the developer community. Its prowess extends beyond just managing large volumes of data with ease; it's equally adept at handling diverse data structures, making it highly suitable for a variety of complex applications.

The choice of MongoDB is further solidified by its growing prominence across multiple domains, not just limited to social media. Its scalability, combined with user-friendly features, positions it as a strategic choice for developers eager to explore and leverage the full potential of NoSQL databases in modern web development.

**NOTES**

-   `MongoDB` a document-orientated & NoSQL data storage
-   `Mongoose` for ODM modelling and easier data access/manipulation
-   `Passport.js` for authentication purposes such as LocalAuth and OAuth2.0
-   `express-session` and `mongo-connect`, respectively, to create and store the sessions
-   `@reduxjs/toolkit` instead of `redux` for simplified apprach to state management

## üìñ Usage

This project is open-source and I welcome anyone to clone the repository. Whether you're curious about my approach or looking to build upon it, feel free to dive in.

I only ask that if you use my code, please don't present it as solely your own creation. If you decide to extend and deploy this X/Twitter clone application, I'd appreciate a shoutout: just add a link back to this repository in your README. Happy exploring!

### üì¶ Installation

The command will clone the repository, and automatically navigate into the project directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:<username>/twitter-clone.git && cd twitter-clone
```

> **_Note_**: Use the following argument when using the docker-compose commands **[--build [service_name]]** whenever you make any Docker-wise changes to rebuild the images and containers.

### üíª Development

The following commands will build the multi-container application in Docker for local development. Volumes have been defined for client and server to create bind mounts for hot-reloading.

Assuming it's your first time using the project, there is no don't need to use the `--build` flag. However, if you make any Docker-wise changes, you will need to use the previously mentioned flag to rebuild the container/s.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

A detailed list of the containers found in the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file:

```
docker-compose ps

NAME       IMAGE             COMMAND                  SERVICE   CREATED       STATUS       PORTS
backend    xclone-backend    "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   server    2 hours ago   Up 2 hours   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
frontend   xclone-frontend   "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   client    2 hours ago   Up 2 hours   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
mongodb    mongo             "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   mongo     2 hours ago   Up 2 hours   0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp
```

### üíª Production

The project uses a multi-stage build with containers communicating over networks to create a production-ready deployement.

The first stage builds the necessary images and containers for the reverse proxy and the database, which are located on the `x-proxy-network` and `x-database-network` networks, respectively.

1. Create the necessary networks.

    ```
    docker network create x-network
    docker network create x-database-network
    ```

2. Build the images and run the containers.

    ```
    docker compose --env-file ./.env.prod -f docker-compose.prod.yml build --no-cache
    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
    docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
    ```

    ```

### ‚ùå Environmental Variables

`env_file` options are set up in `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`. All you have to do is: rename the desired file to exclude the `.sample` suffix and fill in the values accordingly to avoid any issues.

Refer to `.env.sample` and `.env.prod.sample` for the required environmental variables.
